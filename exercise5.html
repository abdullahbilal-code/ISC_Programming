    <p>Exercise 5, Arrays: f5 should take array parameters and return an integer.</p>
    <p>Create a page with a button and two wide input boxes, labelled a and l</p>
    <p>Create a function f5 to return the sum of all the multiples of factors in a 
        found in in l (a and l should be arrays of integers, a is of length 2)</p>
    <p>Call the function f5 in the function called by onClick, and alert the user to the 
        returned answer when they press the button.</p>
    </p>
    <p>You may find the split function useful for creating arrays from the strings entered: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp">Split</a></p>
